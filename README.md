This is just a crashpad/homepage that I made for my self and I named it after a loving silly cat whom tragically died, rip.
Any edits made to this are perfectly fine, if you can fix the ram leak in the notepad on firefox it would greatly benifit me, when I feel like it I will fix the notepads scale resize funtion, already fixed the radar.
I would love if you uploaded your own verison of it so I could see the changes that you've made :P
